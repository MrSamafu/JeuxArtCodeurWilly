Scriptable render pipeline (SRP) :

During the BETA phases the SRP shaders won't be integrated to the tool. To use the SRP shaders you will need to import them manually.

Go to Ciconia Studio\Editor Extensions\Shader Painter\Resources\Shaders.
Open Lightweight Renderer Shaders.rar and import the shaders. Simply replace with the existing ones. Delete the SpecGloss Shaders since they are not supported.
Done!


If you need to go back to the Built-in renderer just extract the shaders from the Built-In Renderer Shaders.rar folder.
